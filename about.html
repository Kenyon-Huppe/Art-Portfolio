                    I'm an undergraduate student in the Information Techonolgy program at the University of Washington.
                    My current career goal is to work as a professional front end web devloper while traveling abroad;
                    something that's known as a "digital nomad". I'm currently learning Japanese and in my free time
                    enjoy reading manga, watching anime, and working out. I'm also am deeply into philosophical talks!

                    I picked up art a while back & spent everyday for 4 hours through the free program Draw-A-Box.
                    Afterwards, I would spend these daily 4 hours drawing the same thing over & over again, encoding the
                    process of art into my mind as much as I could. I genuinly enjoy just creating for the sake of it as
                    I have quite a hyper-active imagination & my mind just feels congested if I'm not creating &
                    expressing my ideas. I hope you enjoy the art that my modest page has to offer it brings some
                    inspiration!
